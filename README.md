Design of Oxidation-Resistant γ/γ′ High-Entropy Alloys Using CALPHAD-Informed Bayesian Optimization
This study presents an integrated computational framework combining Bayesian optimization with physics-informed surrogate modeling to design oxidation-resistant, precipitation-strengthened high-entropy alloys (HEAs).The methodology employs Gaussian process regression with multi-objective Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) to efficiently explore the Pareto front, dramatically reducing the number of required thermodynamic evaluations compared to conventional evolutionary approaches. CALPHAD phase-equilibrium calculations are tightly embedded as the physics oracle, enabling real-time assessment of temperature-dependent phase fractions (FCC, γ′(L1₂), B2, σ) and matrix/precipitate chemistries that directly govern oxidation behavior and high-temperature mechanical performance.
Application of the framework to the Al–Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Cu–Ti system rapidly identified two highly promising alloy classes. The first, NiCoCrFeAl₀.₁₃Ti₀.₁₃ (≈ 25Ni–25Co–22Cr–24Fe–1.5Al–2.6Ti wt.%), exhibits a single FCC phase above ~1250 K and, upon cooling, forms a stable microstructure of FCC matrix + ~25 vol.% coherent γ′(L1₂) + minor B2 + trace σ, delivering exceptional creep resistance with minimal brittle-phase formation. The second, Ni₂CrFeCuAl₀.₃ (≈ 39.6Ni–17.5Cr–18.8Fe–21.4Cu–2.7Al wt.%), solidifies as a single-phase FCC that remains stable to ~1400 K and develops ~20–23 vol.% γ′(L1₂) below ~1300 K with only a small and decreasing fraction of B2 and no deleterious σ or Laves phases at any temperature. Both alloys achieve an outstanding combination of oxidation resistance and high-temperature strength owing to their high γ′ volume fraction, Al-rich yet stable matrices, and near-absence of brittle intermetallics across typical service temperatures (700–1000 °C). The predicted Pareto-optimal compositions have been experimentally validated, confirming the framework’s ability to accelerate inverse design of next-generation oxidation-resistant structural alloys for extreme environments.
